    summary: "Started a solar installation company in Rajasthan. Closed 6/6 pitches, made ₹350k in 2-3 months, then ran into bureaucracy.",
    content: `I graduated in July 2017. Instead of getting a job, I started my first business-**Upvolt Solar**, a residential and commercial solar installation company in Rajasthan. I've always had this itch to build a business, not get a job.

**Why solar in Rajasthan made sense:**

Rajasthan had insane government subsidies (50-70% off solar projects) and a net metering system where you could connect panels to the grid. You'd pay only for net consumption-and if you generated more than you used, the government would pay you ₹3-5 per unit. It felt like an obvious opportunity.

**The pitch that closed 6/6 deals:**

"Pay your 4-year electricity bill today-which you're going to pay anyway-and from that day forward, you don't get an electricity bill for the next 25 years."

Here's the math: An 8kW system generates ~12,800 units/year in Rajasthan. A middle-class household consumes about that much. Their annual bill: ₹89,600. Over 4 years: ₹358,400. The 8kW system after subsidies? ₹360,000. Same price, but no bills for 21 more years.

The best part: **No batteries needed.** Net metering eliminated the need for storage, removing a huge cost and maintenance blocker.

**What actually happened:**

I pitched this to 6 people. Closed all 6. Made ₹6k per kW as commission, working with an installer who handled procurement and installation (I had no capital to invest).

In 2-3 months, I did 6 projects totaling 50kW capacity and made ₹350,000 for myself. I installed the **first rooftop solar projects in a city in Rajasthan.** Literally the first.

**What I feel was the problem:**

I was too early. Government electricity board offices didn't even understand their own schemes. Every project required approvals, inspections, documentation, stamps, notaries, lawyer visits. Even after installation, it took 2-3 months for the net meter to be installed and the project to go live.

I was in remote areas, visiting government offices, waiting, coming back, waiting more. My friends were in Bangalore having fun. I was making money, but I was losing steam.

**What I learned:**

Solar follows a mushroom growth effect. Your neighbors see your bill is ₹0 and instantly want it. Even after I moved to Bangalore, I kept getting inbound leads from referrals. I just sent them to my installation partner.

I left because I wanted to learn more, meet people, and figure out what to build next. But this taught me: **You don't need a lot of capital to start. You need a good pitch, a real problem, and the guts to close deals.**`

    summary: "Moved to Bangalore. Got offers from OYO and Byjus. Chose OYO for culture. Learned B2B sales and never missed a target.",
    content: `After Upvolt Solar, I moved to Bangalore in January 2018. My friends were there, and I wanted to learn how real companies work before building my next business.

**Choosing OYO over Byjus:**

I interviewed at two companies-OYO (referred by a friend) and Byjus. Got offers from both. Byjus was paying more, but I didn't like the culture or the brand. The final interview question sealed it for me:

*"Suppose the month is about to end, and if you close another ₹20k of sales you'll get your ₹50k incentive. The customer can only pay ₹13k. What would you do?"*

They hinted I should cover the ₹7k difference myself to unlock the ₹50k incentive. From that moment, I knew this company wasn't going anywhere. I chose OYO-lower pay, but better culture and a hiring manager (Allister) who seemed solid.

**What I actually did at OYO:**

I was a **Demand Manager** selling "OYO for Business"-a B2B platform that replaced traditional travel desks. Companies could register, set price limits and night limits for employees. Employees booked directly via the OYO app with auto-approval and direct billing to the company. No reimbursement hassles.

I also managed business accounts-handled escalations, coordinated with the ops team to solve issues.

**How it went:**

I found my rhythm in a week. Never missed a single demand goal the entire time I was there. After 6 months, the accounts I was managing were self-sustaining-I could hit my targets just by managing existing clients. I only pushed for new sales if I wanted the extra incentives.

**What I learned:**

This was my first real exposure to **how B2B SaaS can solve broken operational processes**:

**The problem OYO was solving with tech:**
Traditional model = Travel desk person browses websites, makes bookings for employees. OYO's solution = Let the person who's traveling choose and book themselves.

Why this works:
- **Constraints enforced by tech, not people:** Price limits and night limits built into the system-admins don't need to manually check every booking.
- **Reimbursement was broken:** Without a travel desk, employees paid upfront, raised bills, waited for reimbursements. Slow and inefficient.
- **The traveler knows best:** Sales people travel frequently, know locations, are familiar with properties. They have more context than any admin browsing a website.

**What I learned about B2B procurement:**

How decision-making works across different company sizes:
- **Small/medium companies** with no travel desk were easy sells-office admins were drowning in travel coordination.
- **Medium/large companies with no oversight** were where things got interesting. We used **Zeta gift cards** as incentives-1-2% of booking value went into the admin's Zeta card. Gray area (not cash or bribes, but "gifts"). Could be converted to Paytm wallet money. This taught me how companies skew procurement decisions.
- **Large companies with travel desks** were rare to close-too many decision-makers, formal processes, no single point of influence.

**Referrals work like a charm.**

My dad (who worked in pharma sales) referred me to people he knew at Pfizer and Zoetis. I didn't get the business from my dad-I got it from the people he introduced me to. Those referrals gave me all the Bangalore bookings for their sales teams, meetings, and events.

**Why I stayed only 13 months:**

The job felt too easy. I wasn't learning anymore. I hit my targets without breaking a sweat. I wanted to build something, not just manage accounts. So I started looking for what was next.`

    summary: "Worked across Sati Group brands. ShakesBierre (Mar 2019-Mar 2020): Scaled brewery from ₹40L to ₹1.2Cr/month. Post-lockdown (Mar 2020-Oct 2020): Shifted to Sunderlands & other brands for digital growth and SEO.",
    content: `**How I got there:**

In January 2019, I ran into **Shashi** (Operations Head at Bigbrewski) at a bar. He recognized me from Chennai-Hyatt 365, which I used to visit in college (10-15 times). He was a floor manager there.

He called me in February 2019, asking if I'd be open to discuss a hospitality project for business growth. I said sure, why not.

Then I got a call from **Swastik Jalan** (Director, Sati Group)-a self-made, bootstrapped founder who built a natural stone export business with **₹100 crore+ turnover in 23 years**. He wanted to meet at ShakesBierre Brewpub & Kitchen.

I visited. Loved the place. Researched Swastik. He was amazing-enthusiastic, realistic, yet very high goals. **ShakesBierre was his dream project.** He didn't spare any expense. It was a **$1 million USD investment** from him personally.

Without any real interview, he offered me a role: **Grow the business the way I see fit.** Better pay than OYO, plus perks-company car, free beer (obviously), and best of all: **autonomy**.

**Everyone said no.** Friends, family: "ShakesBierre is a brewery, not a company. It's not tech, it's not a startup. You'll sell beer?"

I looked at it objectively: This was a startup with a $1M investment. The goal was clear-make it grow and profitable. Swastik wouldn't burn random money, but was always open to experiment, test, and scale logically.

**I resigned from OYO in Feb 2019,** served my 30-day notice, and **started at ShakesBierre in March 2019.**

**Reporting structure:**

At first, my office was the **Sati Head Office**-not even at ShakesBierre. Why? Swastik didn't tell the ShakesBierre CEO (managing partner) about hiring me.

He wanted to run things from his control. His primary business (stone exports) was exponentially bigger and time-consuming. Looking at the first 3 months' results-revenue and losses-he was sure **something was very wrong** in how ShakesBierre was trying to grow.

So the decision: Hire me directly. **I report directly to the investor/director (Swastik), not the CEO.**

**What I did-First Principles:**

**1. B2B Corporate Events**

First thing that came to mind: Large revenue = B2B events. At OYO, I'd seen companies pay big money for team events at restaurants/bars.

So I got approval to deliver/send **free vouchers** to possible decision-makers at as many companies as I could find. ₹1,000, ₹2,000, ₹5,000 vouchers. **Distributed ₹15 lakh worth of vouchers.**

Why this made sense: Raw material cost is 30-35% to service these orders. Ops is a fixed cost already losing money. So why not?

**2. Digital Marketing & SEO**

Started learning digital marketing and SEO. Optimized the website, Google My Business, social profiles. **It worked.**

Why? Most restaurants/bars don't focus on SEO themselves. They hire ₹30-50k agencies that rarely do any good work.

**3. CEO Became Aware**

From the 3rd month, the CEO became aware of me. I started visiting ShakesBierre as my office, but still **reported directly to the investor**.

I became part of daily growth/partnership meetings with brands like **Zomato, Dineout, EasyDiner.** These platforms would pitch click ads and banner placements for ₹2-5 lakh per month. **We were spending an average ₹15 lakh with these platforms.**

For the first few times, I just observed.

**4. Running My Own Data**

I started running **Google Search ad campaigns** and gathering data-tracking calls, reservations, driving directions, conversion rates-to build ROI data.

Surprisingly, the ROI was **crazy**. Most breweries don't run Google Search ads. They depend on 3rd-party platforms.

**We were getting ₹13/click for searches like "brewery near me."** Zomato was charging ₹36/click.

**5. Pushing Back on Platforms**

In meetings, I started asking questions:

- "Why is Zomato charging ShakesBierre ₹36/click when I see the ShakesBierre ad on Google, which takes me to Zomato, and the cost for such clicks is not ₹36?"
- "Where's the data around banner ads? Number of views, clicks?"

**Response:** "We're not tracking this data." LOL.

The pitch was pure **FOMO**: "Breweries in your area booked banner slot 2 for ₹2 lakh. You should get slot 1 or 3 before someone else does."

CEOs/decision-makers for most breweries would pay without asking questions, in the hope of growth.

**6. The Attribution Problem**

After two months, I had more data. I pushed back:

- Zomato claiming **100 reservations**
- Dineout claiming **50**
- EasyDiner claiming **25**
- My own tracking: **25**

Total claimed: **200 reservations.** Actual: **150.**

This is where I learned the **attribution problem** in depth.

**What I really learned about B2C platforms (Zomato, Swiggy, etc.):**

**It's all about leverage and attribution.**

**Leverage dynamics:**
- If you're **famous**, deals are favorable for you. Why? Apps can ride your brand name to achieve **lower CAC** (customer acquisition cost) for their user acquisition.
- They use your traffic to **sell ads and banners to newer, not-so-famous brands.**
- Think about it: Why would users use Zomato unless famous places they visit are present to make reservations? **They're aggregating demand.**
- To start, Zomato and similar platforms offer deals to famous brands and consumers-**burn money**-but with this traffic and user volume, they use it as **leverage for revenue** from different players.

**Attribution through payments:**
- Ever wonder why you can pay your restaurant dining bill from Zomato/Swiggy-**with discounts**?
- **Because transactions ensure attribution can be claimed by these platforms.**
- Here's the trick: If you're not paying attention as a brand owner, you'll miss this-**many customers coming directly to your business are still paying using the Zomato app to get discounts.**
- Later, in meetings, Zomato shows you "revenue and sales from them" and sells you ads/banners to "grow" that revenue.
- **On a larger scale, this happens A LOT.**

The game is: Famous brands bring users → Platforms aggregate demand → Platforms sell attribution back to brands (even for organic traffic) → Platforms sell ads to new brands using aggregated traffic.

**7. DriveU Partnership (Growth Hack)**

I **gate-crashed** the office of a startup called **DriveU** (new at that time, pretty famous now). They let you book a driver to drive you home. Common use case: Drink and drive.

I went to their office, talked to the founder, and pitched:

**"Every weekend, send push notifications to all your users. If they're visiting ShakesBierre, we'll cover their booking charges-completely free. ₹500 INR (~$8) per ride."**

This was the **first-ever campaign** DriveU did like this.

**Why it made business sense for us:**

- Average car: **3 people**
- Business per person: **₹1,500** (~$24)
- Total: **₹4,500** (~$72)
- **Gross margins: 60%+**
- So ₹500 (~$8) was a no-brainer.

To convince DriveU, we co-branded:
- **Valet tickets** from our brewery with the offer + DriveU branding on the back
- **Banners** across the venue about not drinking and driving

**Results:**
- **20+ cars, 70-90 people per day**
- **₹1.2 lakh revenue/day, ₹8-10 lakh/month** (8% of total revenue at the time)

Free drivers for users → Higher adoption for not drinking and driving. Win for everyone.

**Now this is used by almost every famous brewery in Bangalore.** DriveU has built an ad model around it and charges breweries or partners with them.

**8. Manchester United Partnership**

Partnered with **Manchester United Football Club**-official for 1 year, **totally free**. Started screening games. They became popular.

Then came the **biggest game of the league: Chelsea vs United.** The game got sponsored by Apollo and an alcohol brand.

**Results:**
- **1,200+ tickets sold**
- Brewery gates **closed** (no more space left)
- No tables, chairs-everyone on the ground with beer mugs and snacks

We optimized the menu for days like this: Quick service, max value per person. Can't do fine dining here.

**Also got a backlink from Manchester United's website** → Boosted SEO → More organic reach.

**9. Scaled Google Ads, Cut Platform Spends**

I scaled Google Ads budgets to get more reservations. With these app partners (Zomato, etc.), I **pushed back hard and started cutting down spends.**

Guess what? Since we became popular, **they had no choice but to list us on prime spots** anyway-people were searching for "ShakesBierre" to make reservations. The leverage changed.

**10. Other Initiatives**

- Partnered with **local comics/artists** to host regular open mics (building the culture-it's in the name: "ShakesBierre")
- **First rule-based chatbot** on the website → Chat with the bot, make reservations directly → Few daily reservations from here

**11. Corporate Events (From Voucher Strategy)**

The voucher strategy + popularity started kicking in with **corporate events-multiple almost every week.** High value, low cost.

**Best one: GoJek India Yearly R&R**
- GoJek teams from Indonesia also came
- **₹22 lakh INR billed for 6 hours on a Wednesday night**

**Results:**

**October 2019:**
- **From ₹40 lakh revenue/month with ₹15 lakh marketing spend**
- **To ₹1.2 crore revenue/month with marketing spend <₹2 lakh**

We were already touching the ceiling (avg revenue in that area was ₹1.2-1.4 crore).

**What Happened Next:**

I started researching how to grow revenue further. Idea: **Launch cloud kitchens** with different brand names, served from ShakesBierre's kitchen during slow times (weekday afternoons/evenings, weekend afternoons only).

I created a complete plan: How many brands, why, what would be the cost and effort, what's the upside.

The more I dug, the more promising it became.

Then the CEO started delaying. "Let's shortlist packaging and pricing"-took 3-4 weeks to choose a box.

**I realized why:** The CEO was the managing partner with a **50% profit share**. Any new spend from ShakesBierre would **reduce profits**. The Director (Swastik) wanted to **spend to grow more.** This tug of war was always there.

I parallelly also worked for other Sati Group brands-digital marketing, SEO, Shopify setup to automate sample order delivery for their US unit.

**I couldn't wait. The plan was solid.** What I did next became **Tastewright Hospitality**.

**Post-Lockdown Shift (March 2020 - Oct 2020):**

With ShakesBierre revenue going to ₹0 due to COVID lockdown, I shifted my focus to other **Sati Group brands**-primarily **Sunderlands (Tiles & Stones)**, their US-based natural stone and tile business.

I worked on:
- **Digital growth strategy** for Sunderlands
- **SEO optimization** to drive organic traffic
- **Shopify store setup** to automate demo scheduling for interior design products
- Marketing-focused landing pages driving growth via Pinterest, Facebook, and Google

While parallelly trying to keep Tastewright alive (late nights/early mornings), I was working for Sati Group brands during the day.

By **Sept 2020**, I was exhausted. ShakesBierre wasn't recovering, Tastewright was dying, and I was just doing execution work for Sati brands without the excitement I had when scaling ShakesBierre.

Then Dukaan happened. I **resigned from Sati Group in Sept 2020** and joined Dukaan by **Oct End 2020**.`

    summary: "Scaled to ₹10L/month revenue in 3 months. COVID lockdown + Swiggy's post-paid ad blunder wiped out cash flow. Lost ₹17L total.",
    content: `**The Decision:**

ShakesBierre's CEO kept delaying the cloud kitchen plan. I modified the plan, built calculations, projections. I was very sure: **Right now is the best time to build and scale dark kitchens.**

Why?
- Fairly new market
- Swiggy/Zomato online orders booming
- Low entry barrier
- **Moat?** Food quality, brand quality, operational efficiency

**The Plan: 5 Brands, 1 Kitchen**

1. **BasBiryani** - Only 3 types of biryani, nothing else (not even veg biryani). Lunch/dinner focused.
2. **TheIndianOmelette** - Spicy masala take on omelettes. Breakfast/snacks.
3. **Kukkad** - 2-3 North Indian non-veg curries. Lunch/dinner.
4. **IamFroot** - Fresh cut fruits/juices. Breakfast/health/snacks.
5. **Sliced** - Pizza slices only. Snacks/lunch/dinner.

**Business Strategy:**

- Progressive launch: Start with BasBiryani → Hit ₹4-5L revenue → Launch second brand → Scale faster
- Bring one dark kitchen location to **₹24-28L revenue** → Expand to new locations
- **Choose the toughest market to start:** Koramangala (6,500 brands already delivering food)
- Logic: If I can scale here, I can scale anywhere.

**Partnership & Setup:**

Found a partner to handle ops, kitchen, staff, day-to-day sourcing. Terms: They put up **50% of initial investment** for partnership. They saw and liked the plan.

Shortlisted a location in Koramangala-good delivery area coverage, not prime main roads (we're a dark kitchen, nothing to see here). Everything we showcase is through **food quality & branding/packaging**.

**Design & Branding:**

Hired my childhood friend (designing since age 12, works for TATA, Adobe, TEDx-the best in his field). Paid him only ₹20K.

He designed concepts, logos, packaging for all 6 brands.

**Kitchen Setup:**

- Hired the **assistant chef from Barbeque Nation** (made biryanis under main chefs for years)
- Got FSSAI licenses
- Custom fittings: Gas systems covered/piped outside, separate cleaning/drying areas, ventilation systems
- Kitchen layout and assembly line designed for **6 brands with minimal staff rotation** (that's why limited menus!)
- Equipment cost: **20% over budget** even after sourcing from core/local areas

**Packaging Disaster (Mistake #1):**

Went to packaging partners with custom designs. Learned about **MOQ hell**:
- 1,000 boxes with custom prints: **₹45-55 per box**
- 10,000 boxes: **₹7-10 per box**

We had outer packaging, boxes, glass bottles, jars for desserts. I was very keen: **Since we don't have a facade, the only way to showcase quality is with amazing and unique packaging.**

Can't go with standard boxes (cheaper, no MOQ).

**Solution:** Redesigned packaging to be **modular**-all boxes/jars/bottles can be used across all brands. Only change: **Custom outer sleeves** (fancy sleeves with glue sticking end that wraps around boxes). Common parts (bags, butter papers, tissues) under parent Tastewright Hospitality.

But I still ordered **5,000-10,000 boxes**, going **way over budget**. (I wanted everything to be perfect!)

Custom sleeves printed only for BasBiryani (boxes can be covered with new sleeves when launching new brands).

**Platform Registration & Launch:**

Registered on Swiggy/Zomato. Already knew from ShakesBierre: **We have no leverage. We're at the whims and mercy of aggregators.** Not an issue-we'll grow and change that.

**First week:** 1-2 orders/day via word of mouth and promotions.

**The Problem:**
- Search for "biryani" → Restaurant not listed
- Search brand directly → Restaurant listed

Swiggy account manager: "To get search visibility, you need ~15 reviews on a product. But to get reviews, you need orders. For orders, you need visibility."

Then he sells ads: **Click ads for lunch/dinner periods at ₹27/click.**

**Ads Journey:**

Started with 100-200 clicks. Restaurant popping in and disappearing in <1 min. Orders scaled from 1-2 to 5-7, but clicks were random-sometimes not even used.

Bought **1,000 clicks** → Things improved. Orders increased. Platform rating: **4.9 consistently**.

This continued for 2-2.5 months. **By Dec 2019:** Revenue hitting **₹3L** with **60%+ 30-day retention**.

But ads cost was eating into revenue and very random-sometimes never used, sometimes all clicks consumed in 2 mins and restaurant disappears from top listing.

**My theory:** Swiggy has limited space per food category per user. We're in Koramangala-many cloud kitchens and larger brands buying ads. Swiggy doesn't have a perfect algo (startup, scaling fast). If another brand bought 1,000 clicks and we have 100, someone else gets priority.

**The "Hack" That Became the Blunder:**

End of Dec 2019: Swiggy account partner calls. "We can sell ad clicks in bulk at **₹7/click**-1/3 of what you're paying."

We had enough data: Every 10 clicks = 1.5 orders. Rating high, retention great.

I did the math: **I want to be visible all the time during lunch and dinner peak hours. All the time. I don't care.**

Bought **10,000 clicks for Jan 2020**.

**The great part:** Swiggy click-based ads were **POST-PAID**-deducted from weekly payout, charged only if utilized.

Since we had good conversions and retention, theoretically we'd only grow and hit a ceiling at max.

**It worked.**

- Order volumes increased
- **Jan 2020: ₹4-5L revenue, break-even** (rent, raw cost, salaries, bills)
- Every extra lakh from this location = Profitable (ops doesn't increase, raw cost 30% scales with revenue)

**Feb 2020:** Increased click purchase volume. Tried to optimize and find max clicks we can consume per day. (Clicks were monthly. When they'd run out, adding new ones took 3-10 days-no self-serve, had to talk to account managers.)

Found the sweet spot: **1,200 clicks/day max** (1 PM - 3 PM, 8 PM - 10 PM).

**Feb 2020: Breached ₹10L revenue.** One day: **120 orders!** Finally profitable on one brand.

**March 2020:** Planned to launch new brand. Bought **120,000 clicks**. Everything seemed smooth-same trend as Feb.

**Then COVID Hit (March 21, 2020):**

Lockdown announcement. **Shit broke apart.**

- People stopped ordering
- Due to lockdown, **max click volume shot up exponentially**
- **No way to pause ads, no self-serve**
- In 2-3 days: **~140,000 clicks/day consumed!**
- Orders: **2-3 only**
- No one to contact, no response
- **Ads cost: ₹3-3.5 lakh without revenue**

Since ads are post-paid (deducted from payouts):
- Week 3 March payout (expected ₹2-3L from sales) → **₹0**
- Week 4 March payout → **Negative** (clicks exhausted)

**The theoretical hack became the biggest blunder.**

**The Downward Spiral:**

2-4 weeks later, online orders started booming again (panic reduced for food delivery).

But we don't have enough cash flow to confidently purchase clicks. I'm pissed at Swiggy. I don't want to purchase.

Now getting orders only from **repeat/loyal users** (not very high).

**Revenue crash:**
- March: ₹10L+
- April: ₹4L
- May: ₹2.5L

Back to loss due to minimum fixed operating cost.

**Survival Mode:**

- Started cutting costs
- Launched **IamFroot** (second brand-only fruits, buy daily and sell, easy/fast)
- Launched **food subscriptions** for people in PGs/hostels nearby (20 active subscribers)

But it became hard and painful.

**The Cash Flow Crisis:**

- **Initial investment: ₹12L total**
  - ₹3L setup
  - ₹4.5-5L packaging material (way over budget)
  - ₹4L operating budget
- Poured **additional ₹5L** to sustain for 6 months even with 0 orders
- **Plan:** Be profitable in 6 months or at least self-sustainable cash flow

By March 2020: Only **₹1-1.5L in bank**. Expected ₹2-3L from sales → Went to **zero**. Stuck.

Somehow sustained till **Sept 2020** with that ₹1.5L. Decided to **wind down operations**-no end in sight for lockdowns, no confidence or energy left to raise capital.

**While doing all this, I was parallelly working for ShakesBierre** (late night/early morning for Tastewright). With lockdown, ShakesBierre went to ₹0 from March. That also became a problem. I worked for other Sati brands, but I was just pissed with what happened.

**Major Mistakes:**
1. Getting money stuck in inventory (packaging-wanted perfection)
2. Swiggy post-paid ad blunder

**The Dukaan Connection:**

**July 2020:** Dukaan platform launched. BasBiryani became the **first power user**. All subscription food orders, any direct order I'd try to take from here. Tried running some ads, but CAC was ₹200-300-can't compete with Swiggy/Zomato online food order ads.

Got calls from **Suumit/Subhash** (Dukaan founders) for feedback. First call, I figured out: "Are you Dukaan's founder? The way you're asking questions about features, is it worth ₹200/month, etc."

Yes, he was. Dukaan wasn't famous at that time.

We had regular calls. By **Sept 2020,** Dukaan got VC traction. Suumit wanted to expand. He offered me to come over to Dukaan and help build the B2B SaaS platform for business owners to run and manage independent stores. I was in a decent position to understand the business.

**The End:**

Cut my losses on Tastewright: **₹17L total** (₹12L from my end).

Resigned from Sati Group.

**Oct End 2020:** Started at Dukaan. Goal: Assist Suumit and develop the product.

**What I learned:**

- **Operational efficiency matters.** Limited menus, modular packaging, assembly line thinking.
- **Platform leverage is everything.** No leverage = No control.
- **Cash flow > Revenue.** Profitability and cash management are not the same thing.
- **Inventory risk.** Wanting perfection cost me ₹5L in packaging upfront.
- **Post-paid anything is a double-edged sword.** Great when things work. Lethal when they don't.
- **You can do everything right and still lose.** COVID was a black swan. But the packaging mistake and post-paid gamble made recovery impossible.`

**The AI Journey at Dukaan:**

In 2020-2021, we started using **GPT-3** (one of the first useful models for business) for text completion. Added functionality for store owners to create product meta titles and meta descriptions for SEO. It worked well.

Then in 2022, **GPT-3.5** launched. Chat format instead of text completion. This fundamentally changed how we could use these models. I started using it heavily-analyzing data, exploring repos (AutoGPT-180k GitHub stars), learning how to build AI agents.

I spent 6 months learning. Then I started finding solutions to solve support at scale for Dukaan:
- Built a simple chatbot
- Built a RAG system with embedded docs in Pinecone
- Added tools so the chatbot could connect to Freshdesk (read, update, create tickets)
- Added authentication

We implemented it at a company level. The founders and I turned it into a separate product: **[bot9.ai](https://bot9.ai/)**, which made international headlines (covered in **TechCrunch, Insider, VentureBeat**).

I led product and growth for bot9.ai while continuing at Dukaan. This is where I started using AI tools heavily-not just for the product, but for my own workflow.

**What I learned:**

- **How to talk to users, run experiments, analyze data, and ship features that actually moved metrics.** Not just building cool stuff-building stuff that makes the business grow.
- **Product-market fit at scale.** Working with 1M+ merchants taught me what works and what doesn't.
- **AI can be a force multiplier.** Not just for products, but for your own productivity.
- **It's not about what you build. It's about whether it works for the people using it and the business running it.**

**May 2024:** Left Dukaan to go back to **build mode**-focusing on my own products, learning, and experimenting with AI.`

    content: `**May 2024:** Left Dukaan after 3.5 years to go back to **build mode**-focusing on my own products, freelancing, and teaching.

Since leaving, I've been freelancing + trying to figure out what SaaS problems to solve-building, testing, iterating.

**What I've been building:**

**[Shipstation.ai](https://firstsite.app/) (Jan 2024 - Present, started while at Dukaan)**
- Co-founded an AI-powered platform that automates end-to-end process of designing, coding, deploying, and hosting personal portfolios and websites
- Onboarded **1,700+ users**
- Leveraged cutting-edge AI: Anthropic, Tavily, and OpenAI

**Freelancing (Jun 2024 - Present)**
- Product developer & consultant
- Projects: Wallscope App (wall structure mapping), Trekkit (Shopify store), Delta Exchange (AI support bot + PM productivity tool with Freshdesk integration)

**[Teacherop](https://teacherop.com) (Jul 2024 - Present)**
- Building a different kind of online learning platform
- Core function: Help figure out the actual concepts you don't know and need to learn to achieve any given goal
- Focusing on STEM subjects

**[ReplyDaddy](https://replydaddy.com) (Aug 2025 - Present)**
- Building a co-pilot for Reddit marketers
- AI-powered lead scoring engine that finds relevant posts and comments to engage with
- Helps draft comments based on user persona, factual work history, brand data, and tone
- Tech: Anthropic Claude, Supabase, Flask, React.js

**Teaching (The Accidental Series):**

I've been a member of **GrowthX Club** since 2023. Mostly a lurker. In the #ai-ai-ai Slack channel, I posted: "If anyone needs to learn how to build AI tools/agents from scratch, comment and we can schedule a few online sessions."

I expected 6-7 people. **60+ folks** (founders of AI companies, bootstrap builders, PMs) reached out. It snowballed into a full GrowthX event on **Nov 2, 2025**.

From a simple comment-purely because I wanted to help with no strings attached-into my first ever learning session. I took 2 sessions, they went well. I'll do the planned 3rd session, and that's it.

**I don't actively teach or plan to become an online teacher.** This was an accident. If anyone wants to watch and learn, it's available. (More on that in the Teaching section.)

**Philosophy:**

- **Build products that make money.** Not "passion projects" or "portfolio pieces"-actual products with real revenue.
- **Use AI to build faster and cheaper** than traditional development.
- **Learn in public.** Write about what I'm building, what's working, and what's failing. No guru BS, no "I made $100k in 30 days" nonsense-just honest documentation of what it's like to build products in 2025 with AI.

I don't have all the answers. But I know how to figure things out, and I'm getting faster at it.`
