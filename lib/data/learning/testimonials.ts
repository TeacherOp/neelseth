    content: "First of all, thank you for taking the time to share your learning. It was a very useful and insightful session. The content was extremely well organized, and I especially appreciated the hands on approach. Personally, I find it much easier to understand code than documentation, so having your examples cover the basics in such depth really helped clarify the finer details of working with LLMs. If I may suggest, it would be great if future sessions could start on time, considering how valuable both the hosts' and participants' time is. Punctuality helps everyone make the most of the learning opportunity. Also, given the richness of the material, it might work even better if the content were split into two 2-hour sessions, spaced about a week apart. This would give participants time to experiment with the initial steps before returning for a more hands-on continuation. I'm looking forward to trying out the code myself. It's truly a time saver when an expert, especially one self trained, takes the time to explain the logic behind their work so clearly. Thank you once again for an excellent and engaging session.",
