    content: `
From 2023, I was building products with AI tools-using ChatGPT for ideation, Claude for coding, and various APIs to ship faster. A friend at **GrowthX** saw what I was doing and asked if I'd teach their community how to use AI tools to build products.

I wasn't an expert. I was just someone who figured things out. But that turned out to be the point.

Most "AI courses" are taught by people who already know how to code. They assume you understand APIs, JSON, and terminal commands. I didn't come from that background-I learned all of this using AI as my coding partner. So I could teach it the way I actually learned it: **messy, iterative, and focused on getting things to work instead of being "correct."**

The first cohort had 50 people. Then 100. Then requests for more sessions. Now the free course materials on GitHub have been used by **150+ people** learning to build AI tools without a CS degree.`
